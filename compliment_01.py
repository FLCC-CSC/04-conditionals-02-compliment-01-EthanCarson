'''

1. On a scale of 1 to 10 (where 10 is the hardest), how would you rate this lab?

I'd probably rate it a 3 out of 10. It's not as simple as printing something to the screen, it requires both user input and an if clause, but both are still on a basic level.


2. What was the hardest part of this lab?
Funilly enough, just remembering that to check equality, you need 2 equal signs, strange I forgot that coming off of JS.
